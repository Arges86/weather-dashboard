# weather-dashboard

A Small Dashboard program to show weather information.   
Best to run in a device like the raspberry pi on an old monitor to display your local weather info.

# Requirements for use
1. You need to have an API Key from Open Weather Map.
   1. They are free and can be obtained from here: [https://openweathermap.org/appid#signup](https://openweathermap.org/appid#signup)
1. You need to know your latitude and longitude
   1. They can be found here: [https://latitudeandlongitude.org/](https://latitudeandlongitude.org/)

# Quick start

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, then type the following commands known to every Node developer...
```
git clone https://github.com/Arges86/weather-dashboard.git
cd weather-dashboard
npm install
npm start
```
...and you have a running desktop application on your screen.

# Structure of the project

The application consists of two main folders...

`src` - files within this folder get transpiled or compiled (because Electron can't use them directly).

`app` - contains all static assets which don't need any pre-processing. Put here images, CSSes, HTMLs, etc.

The build process compiles the content of the `src` folder and puts it into the `app` folder, so after the build has finished, your `app` folder contains the full, runnable application.

Treat `src` and `app` folders like two halves of one bigger thing.

# Development

## Starting the app

```
npm start
```

## The build pipeline

Build process uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). The entry-points are `src/background.js` and `src/app.js`. Webpack will follow all `import` statements starting from those files and compile code of the whole dependency tree into one `.js` file for each entry point.

[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is also utilised, but mainly for its great error messages. Electron under the hood runs latest Chromium, hence most of the new JavaScript features are already natively supported.

## Environments

Environmental variables are done in a bit different way (not via `process.env`). Env files are plain JSONs in `config` directory, and build process dynamically links one of them as an `env` module. You can import it wherever in code you need access to the environment.
```js
import env from "env";
console.log(env.name);
```

## Upgrading Electron version

To do so edit `package.json`:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "electron": "2.0.2"
}
```
*Side note:* [Electron authors recommend](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning/) to use fixed version here.

## Adding npm modules to your app

Remember to respect the split between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in `package.json` file. Your distributable app will contain modules listed in `dependencies` after running the release script.

*Side note:* If the module you want to use in your app is a native one (not pure JavaScript but compiled binary) you should first  run `npm install name_of_npm_module` and then `npm run postinstall` to rebuild the module for Electron. You need to do this once after you're first time installing the module. Later on, the postinstall script will fire automatically with every `npm install`.

# Making a release

To package your app into an installer use command:
```
npm run release
```

Once the packaging process finished, the `dist` directory will contain your distributable file.

We use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to handle the packaging process. It has a lot of [customization options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration), which you can declare under `"build"` key in `package.json`.

You can package your app cross-platform from a single operating system, [electron-builder kind of supports this](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build), but there are limitations and asterisks. That's why this boilerplate doesn't do that by default.
